# Instructions
- This proof-of-concept is built using [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
- Changes merged into the `main` branch will be automatically build and published at: https://ray-project.github.io/q4-2021-docs-hackathon
- Using [mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike) to manage versioning
  - Note that the Github CI is using a fake version (i.e. v0.3). It will always deploy changes to the 0.3 version just for demo purposes.
