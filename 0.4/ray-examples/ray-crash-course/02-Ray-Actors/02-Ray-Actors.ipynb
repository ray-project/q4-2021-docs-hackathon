    "Using Ray _tasks_ is great for distributing work around a cluster, but we've said nothing so far about managing distributed _state_, one of the big challenges in distributed computing. Ray tasks are great for _stateless_ computation, but we need something for _stateful_ computation. \n",

    "If you've worked with data processing libraries like [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) or big data tools like [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org), you know that they provide rich features for manipulating large, structured _data sets_, i.e., the analogs of tables in a database. Some tools even support partitioning of these data sets over clusters for scalability.\n",

    "This isn't the kind of distributed \"state\" Ray addresses. Instead, it's the more open-ended _graph of objects_ found in more general-purpose applications. For example, it could be the state of a game engine used in a reinforcement learning (RL) application or the total set of parameters in a giant neural network, some of which now have hundreds of millions of parameters."

    "The [Actor Model of Concurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) is almost 50 years old! It's a _message-passing_ model, where autonomous blocks of code, the actors, receive messages from other actors asking them to perform work or return some results. Implementations provide thread safety while the messages are processed, one at a time. This means the user of an actor model implementation doesn't have to worry about writing thread-safe code. Because many messages might arrive while one is being processed, they are stored in a queue and processed one at a time, the order of arrival. \n",

    "\n",
    "* Once a _task_ finishes, it is removed from the worker that executed it, while an actor is _pinned_ to the worker until all Python references to it in the driver program are out of scope. That is, the usual garbage collection mechanism in Python determines when an actor is no longer needed and is removed from a worker. The reason the actor must remain in memory is because it holds state that might be needed, whereas tasks are stateless.\n",

For now, an important design consideration is to decide when you need to _checkpoint_ state and to use an appropriate mechanism for this purpose.
