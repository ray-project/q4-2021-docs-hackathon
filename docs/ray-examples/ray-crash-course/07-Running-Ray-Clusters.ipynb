    "In the previous lessons, we let `ray.init()` start a mini-cluster on your laptop or connect to the running Ray cluster in the Anyscale hosted platform. This lesson discusses using the Ray CLI command `ray` to create and manage Ray clusters. We won't cover all the subcommands `ray` supports. Try `ray --help` and see the [Ray CLI documentation](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/package-ref.html#the-ray-command-line-api) for more details."

    "> 1. The Anyscale hosted platform has its own CLI command, `anyscale`, which integrates the `ray` CLI and provides other capabilities for managing and running Ray projects and sessions, including automated cluster integration, synchronization of code to your local development environment, etc. Further information on this service will be available soon. [Contact us](mailto:academy@anyscale.com) for details.\n",
    "> 2. Ray can now be used with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). You can find the published Docker images [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=Rayproject&type=image). For more details, see the documentation [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/installation.html?highlight=docker#launch-ray-in-docker) and [here](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/cloud.html?highlight=docker#common-cluster-configurations)."
