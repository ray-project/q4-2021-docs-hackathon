Slightly more sophisticated algorithms are [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), which count the short `n`-word phrases, and [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index), which builds a dictionary of words and the locations the words were found, the basis of a search engine!\n",
